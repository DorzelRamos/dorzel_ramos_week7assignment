    <h1>Selectors & Filters</h1>
    <div class="basicSelect">
    <h2> Basic Selectors </h2>
    <p id="jqSelect"> JQuery Selectors use a dollar sign ($) at the beginning of each of their selectors. It also uses hashtags (#) for ids, periods (.) for classNames, and can target tag elements similar to CSS. JQuery selectors can also use the asterix, or <i>wild card</i> (*) to target all the elements in the page</p>
    </div>
    <div class="basicFilt">
        <h2>Basic Filters</h2>
        <p id="jqFilter"> Filters come after a semicolon (:) and can filter things by <i>first and last</i>, <i>odds and evens</i>, <i>gt (greater than), lt (less than), eq (equal to)</i>, <i>animated</i>, <i>focus</i>, and <i>not(expr), or non expressions</i></p>

        <p class="para1">Here is another paragraph</p>
        <p class="para2">Here is another paragraph</p>
    </div>
    <div class="advSelect">
        <h2>Advanced Selectors</h2>
        <p>When the <b>(>) selector</b> is used that means "select this tag only if its an immediate child of the parent". <b>Descendant selectors</b> select anything inside the element and doesn't have to be an immediate child. The <b>adjacent selector (+)</b>  means "select this element right after this element". The <b>(~) selector</b> means "select each element as long as it has this element as its sibling", so elements following the previous one will be selected.</p>
        <!-- For the (>) selector in the div element all of the paragraphs inside it are the immediate children, but if theres a section inside it all the paragraphs inside the section won't be selected -->

        <p class="para1">Here is another paragraph</p>
        <p class="para2">Here is another paragraph</p>
    </div>
    <div class="atrFilt">
        <h2>Attribute Filters</h2>
        <p>These lets you perform tests to see if attributes are being used. Attribute filters are used inside <b>[] brackets</b> after the tag. These can filter out classes and ids. The <b>(^=) filter</b> means pick out a name that starts with this string. The <b> (*=) filter</b> means pick out an element that contians this certain string</p>

        <p class="para1">Here is another paragraph</p>
        <p class="para2">Here is another paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advFilt">
        <h2>Advanced Filters</h2>
        <p>The <b>contains filter</b> selects elements with a certain text. The <b>parent filter</b> means "select these tags as long as their parents". So anything with a child or a textnode is considered a parent. The <b>has filter</b> selects paragraphs with a certain class. The <b>child filter</b> selects paragraph tags inside of an element. This can be used with <i>first</i>, <i>last</i>, and <i>last-type-of</i>. The <b>n-th filter</b> selects the number of the child inside an element. So if a paragraph is the third child of an element it can select the third child</p>
